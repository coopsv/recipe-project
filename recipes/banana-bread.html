        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The trick to really good banana bread is using <strong>ripe</strong> bananas. 
                I think they're best when they're just starting to get some brown spots, but they're too far gone when the entire banana is brown.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
                    <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of milk</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>Â½ cup of softened butter</li>
                    <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (optional)</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>How-To</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass.</li>
                    <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl.</li>
                    <li>Beat butter and sugar in a third bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs to butter mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
                        Stir banana mixture into butter mixture. Stir in dry mixture until blended. Fold in chocolate chips until just combined. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
                </ol>
