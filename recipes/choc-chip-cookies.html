        <h2>How-To</h2>
            <h3>Part One</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla.</li> 
                <li>Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds.</li>
                <li>Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them.</li>
                <li>Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours.</li> 
                <li>Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>...Several Hours Later</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Scoop 6 3 1/2-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day. </li>
                <li>Eat warm, with a big napkin.</li>
            </ol>
