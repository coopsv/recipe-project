        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Every year around Independence Day, I make this recipe for my friends and family. It's gone almost as soon as I finish making it.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>one package 5.9oz of instant chocolate pudding</li>
                <li>3 cups of cold milk</li>
                <li>one 16oz tub of whipped topping</li>
                <li>one package of double stuffed oreos</li>
                <li>gummy worms (optional, personally I don't like it</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>How-To</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the instant chocolate pudding, using the instructions on the box 
                    <em>(this will utilise the milk needed for this recipe)</em></li>
                <li>While the instant pudding is setting, put all <strong>except</strong> 5 or 6 of the oreos into a gallon-sized ziplock bag and seal. 
                    Then, using the back of a large spoon, crush the oreos (this is great step for anyone who needs to work out some frustration) </li>
                <li>Grab a large bowl- I like a clear one so you can see the layers. Put a thin layer of the chocolate pudding at the bottom of the bowl, followed by a layer of crushed oreos, and then the whipped topping.</li>
                <li>Alternate layers however you like until all of the crushed oreos/whipped topping, and chocolate pudding have been used.</li>
                <li>For best results, let sit overnight then add your remaing few oreos to the top before serving.</li>
            </ol>
